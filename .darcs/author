# Each patch is attributed to its author, usually by email address (for
# example, `Fred Bloggs <fred@example.net>`).  Darcs looks in several
# places for this author string: the `--author` option, the files
# `_darcs/prefs/author` (in the repository) and `~/.darcs/author` (in your
# home directory), and the environment variables `$DARCS_EMAIL` and
# `$EMAIL`.  If none of those exist, Darcs will prompt you for an author
# string and write it to `~/.darcs/author`.  Note that if you have more
# than one email address, you can put them all in `~/.darcs/author`,
# one author per line.  Darcs will still prompt you for an author, but it
# allows you to select from the list, or to type in an alternative.
